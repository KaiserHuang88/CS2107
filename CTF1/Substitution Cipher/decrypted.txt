NOTE THAT IF YOU ARE A VOLUME LICENSE CUSTOMER, USE OF THIS SOFTWARE IS SUBYECT TO YOUR VOLUME LICENSE AGREEMENT RATHER THAN THIS AGREEMENT.

THIS AGREEMENT DESCRIBES YOUR RIGHTS AND THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH YOU MAY USE THE WINDOWS SOFTWARE.

IF ACTIVATION FAILS, THE SOFTWARE WILL ATTEMPT TO REPAIR ITSELF BY REPLACING ANY TAMPERED MICROSOFT SOFTWARE WITH GENUINE MICROSOFT SOFTWARE. YOU MAY ALSO RECEIVE REMINDERS TO OBTAIN A PROPER LICENSE FOR THE SOFTWARE. SUCCESSFUL ACTIVATION DOES NOT CONFIRM THAT THE SOFTWARE IS GENUINE OR PROPERLY LICENSED. YOU MAY NOT BYPASS OR CIRCUMVENT ACTIVATION. TO HELP DETERMINE IF YOUR SOFTWARE IS GENUINE AND WHETHER YOU ARE PROPERLY LICENSED, SEE (AKA.MS/GENUINE). CERTAIN UPDATES, SUPPORT, AND OTHER SERVICES MIGHT ONLY BE OFFERED TO USERS OF GENUINE MICROSOFT SOFTWARE.

DEPENDING ON HOW YOU OBTAINED THE WINDOWS SOFTWARE, MICROSOFT, OR THE DEVICE MANUFACTURER OR INSTALLER, WARRANTS THAT PROPERLY LICENSED SOFTWARE WILL PERFORM SUBSTANTIALLY AS DESCRIBED IN ANY MICROSOFT MATERIALS THAT ACCOMPANY THE SOFTWARE. THIS LIMITED WARRANTY DOES NOT COVER PROBLEMS THAT YOU CAUSE, THAT ARISE WHEN YOU FAIL TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS, OR THAT ARE CAUSED BY EVENTS BEYOND THE REASONABLE CONTROL OF MICROSOFT, OR THE DEVICE MANUFACTURER OR INSTALLER. THE LIMITED WARRANTY STARTS WHEN THE FIRST USER ACQUIRES THE SOFTWARE, AND LASTS FOR ONE YEAR IF ACQUIRED FROM MICROSOFT, OR FOR 90 DAYS IF ACQUIRED FROM A DEVICE MANUFACTURER OR INSTALLER. IF YOU OBTAIN UPDATES OR SUPPLEMENTS DIRECTLY FROM MICROSOFT DURING THE 90-DAY TERM OF THE DEVICE MANUFACTURER¬ÄôS OR INSTALLER¬ÄôS LIMITED WARRANTY, MICROSOFT PROVIDES THE LIMITED WARRANTY FOR THOSE UPDATES OR SUPPLEMENTS. ANY SUPPLEMENTS, UPDATES, OR REPLACEMENT SOFTWARE THAT YOU MAY RECEIVE FROM MICROSOFT DURING THAT YEAR ARE ALSO COVERED, BUT ONLY FOR THE REMAINDER OF THAT ONE-YEAR PERIOD IF ACQUIRED FROM MICROSOFT, OR FOR 90 DAYS IF ACQUIRED FROM A DEVICE MANUFACTURER OR INSTALLER, OR FOR 30 DAYS, WHICHEVER IS LONGER. TRANSFERRING THE SOFTWARE WILL NOT EJTEND THE LIMITED WARRANTY.

B.      DISCLAIMER. NEITHER MICROSOFT, NOR THE DEVICE MANUFACTURER OR INSTALLER, GIVES ANY OTHER EJPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS. MICROSOFT AND THE DEVICEMANUFACTURER AND INSTALLEREJCLUDE ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THOSE OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. IF YOUR LOCAL LAW DOES NOT ALLOW THE EJCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, THEN ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS LAST ONLY DURING THE TERM OF THE LIMITED WARRANTY AND ARE LIMITED AS MUCH AS YOUR LOCAL LAW ALLOWS. IF YOUR LOCAL LAW REQUIRES A LONGER LIMITED WARRANTY TERM, DESPITE THIS AGREEMENT, THEN THAT LONGER TERM WILL APPLY, BUT YOU CAN RECOVER ONLY THE REMEDIES THIS AGREEMENT ALLOWS.

C.      LIMITED REMEDY. IF MICROSOFT, OR THE DEVICE MANUFACTURER OR INSTALLER, BREACHES ITS LIMITED WARRANTY, IT WILL, AT ITS ELECTION, EITHER: (I) REPAIR OR REPLACE THE SOFTWARE AT NO CHARGE, OR (II) ACCEPT RETURN OF THE SOFTWARE (OR AT ITS ELECTION THE DEVICE ON WHICH THE SOFTWARE WAS PREINSTALLED) FOR A REFUND OF THE AMOUNT PAID, IF ANY. THE DEVICE MANUFACTURER OR INSTALLER (OR MICROSOFT IF YOU ACQUIRED THEM DIRECTLY FROM MICROSOFT) MAY ALSO REPAIR OR REPLACE SUPPLEMENTS, UPDATES, AND REPLACEMENT OF THE SOFTWARE OR PROVIDE A REFUND OF THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THEM, IF ANY. THESE ARE YOUR ONLY REMEDIES FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY. THIS LIMITED WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE OR COUNTRY TO COUNTRY.

D.      DAMAGES. EJCEPT FOR ANY REPAIR, REPLACEMENT, OR REFUND THAT MICROSOFT, OR THE DEVICE MANUFACTURER OR INSTALLER, MAY PROVIDE, YOU MAY NOT UNDER THIS LIMITED WARRANTY, UNDER ANY OTHER PART OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR UNDER ANY THEORY, RECOVER ANY DAMAGES OR OTHER REMEDY, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS OR DIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES. THE DAMAGE EJCLUSIONS AND REMEDY LIMITATIONS IN THIS AGREEMENT APPLY EVEN IF REPAIR, REPLACEMENT, OR A REFUND DOES NOT FULLY COMPENSATE YOU FOR ANY LOSSES, IF MICROSOFT, OR THE DEVICE MANUFACTURER OR INSTALLER, KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF THE DAMAGES, OR IF THE REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. SOME STATES AND COUNTRIES DO NOT ALLOW THE EJCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR OTHER DAMAGES, SO THOSE LIMITATIONS OR EJCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IF YOUR LOCAL LAW ALLOWS YOU TO RECOVER DAMAGES FROM MICROSOFT, OR THE DEVICE MANUFACTURER OR INSTALLER, EVEN THOUGH THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT, YOU CANNOT RECOVER MORE THAN YOU PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE (OR UP TO $50 USD IF YOU ACQUIRED THE SOFTWARE FOR NO CHARGE).

E.      WARRANTY AND REFUND PROCEDURES.

IF WE CAN¬ÄôT, YOU AND WE AGREE TO BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION BEFORE THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (¬ÄúAAA¬Äù) UNDER THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT (¬ÄúFAA¬Äù), AND NOT TO SUE IN COURT IN FRONT OF A YUDGE OR YURY. INSTEAD, A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR WILL DECIDE AND THE ARBITRATOR¬ÄôS DECISION WILL BE FINAL EJCEPT FOR A LIMITED RIGHT OF REVIEW UNDER THE FAA. CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS, CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY-GENERAL ACTIONS, AND ANY OTHER PROCEEDING WHERE SOMEONE ACTS IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY AREN¬ÄôT ALLOWED. NOR IS COMBINING INDIVIDUAL PROCEEDINGS WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES. ¬ÄúWE,¬Äù ¬ÄúOUR,¬Äù AND ¬ÄúUS¬Äù INCLUDES MICROSOFT, THE DEVICE MANUFACTURER, AND SOFTWARE INSTALLER.

C.      SMALL CLAIMS COURT OPTION. INSTEAD OF MAILING A NOTICE OF DISPUTE, AND IF YOU MEET THE COURT¬ÄôS REQUIREMENTS, YOU MAY SUE US IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT IN YOUR COUNTY OF RESIDENCE (OR, IF A BUSINESS, YOUR PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS) OR OUR PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS¬ÄîKING COUNTY, WASHINGTON USA IF YOUR DISPUTE IS WITH MICROSOFT.

D.      ARBITRATION PROCEDURE. THE AAA WILL CONDUCT ANY ARBITRATION UNDER ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES (OR IF YOU ARE AN INDIVIDUAL AND USE THE SOFTWARE FOR PERSONAL OR HOUSEHOLD USE, OR IF THE VALUE OF THE DISPUTE IS $75,000 USD OR LESS WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE AN INDIVIDUAL OR HOW YOU USE THE SOFTWARE, ITS CONSUMER ARBITRATION RULES).

IN A DISPUTE INVOLVING $25,000 USD OR LESS, ANY HEARING WILL BE TELEPHONIC UNLESS THE ARBITRATOR FINDS GOOD CAUSE TO HOLD AN IN-PERSON HEARING INSTEAD. ANY IN-PERSON HEARING WILL TAKE PLACE IN YOUR COUNTY OF RESIDENCE (OR, IF A BUSINESS, YOUR PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS) OR OUR PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS¬ÄîKING COUNTY, WASHINGTON IF YOUR DISPUTE IS WITH MICROSOFT. YOU CHOOSE. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES TO YOU INDIVIDUALLY AS A COURT COULD. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD DECLARATORY OR INYUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY TO YOU INDIVIDUALLY TO SATISFY YOUR INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. UNDER AAA RULES, THE ARBITRATOR RULES ON HIS OR HER OWN YURISDICTION, INCLUDING THE ARBITRABILITY OF ANY CLAIM. BUT A COURT HAS EJCLUSIVE AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE THE PROHIBITION ON ARBITRATION ON A CLASS-WIDE BASIS OR IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.

E.      ARBITRATION FEES AND PAYMENTS.

THE DEVICE MANUFACTURER OR INSTALLER (OR MICROSOFT IF YOUR DISPUTE IS WITH MICROSOFT) WILL PROMPTLY REIMBURSE YOUR FILING FEES AND PAY THE AAA¬ÄôS AND ARBITRATOR¬ÄôS FEES AND EJPENSES. IF YOU REYECT OUR LAST WRITTEN SETTLEMENT OFFER MADE BEFORE THE ARBITRATOR WAS APPOINTED, YOUR DISPUTE GOES ALL THE WAY TO AN ARBITRATOR¬ÄôS DECISION (CALLED AN ¬ÄúAWARD¬Äù), AND THE ARBITRATOR AWARDS YOU MORE THAN THIS LAST WRITTEN OFFER, THE DEVICE MANUFACTURER OR INSTALLER (OR MICROSOFT IF YOUR DISPUTE IS WITH MICROSOFT) WILL: (1) PAY THE GREATER OF THE AWARD OR $1,000 USD; (2) PAY YOUR REASONABLE ATTORNEY¬ÄôS FEES, IF ANY; AND (3) REIMBURSE ANY EJPENSES (INCLUDING EJPERT WITNESS FEES AND COSTS) THAT YOUR ATTORNEY REASONABLY ACCRUES FOR INVESTIGATING, PREPARING, AND PURSUING YOUR CLAIM IN ARBITRATION.

(II)     DISPUTES INVOLVING MORE THAN $75,000 USD. THE AAA RULES WILL GOVERN PAYMENT OF FILING FEES AND THE AAA¬ÄôS AND ARBITRATOR¬ÄôS FEES AND EJPENSES.

G.      SEVERABILITY. IF ANY PART OF SECTION 11 (BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER) IS FOUND TO BE ILLEGAL OR UNENFORCEABLE, THE REMAINDER WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT (WITH AN ARBITRATION AWARD ISSUED BEFORE ANY COURT PROCEEDING BEGINS), EJCEPT THAT IF A FINDING OF PARTIAL ILLEGALITY OR UNENFORCEABILITY WOULD ALLOW CLASS-WIDE OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATION, SECTION 11 WILL BE UNENFORCEABLE IN ITS ENTIRETY.

H.      CONFLICT WITH AAA RULES. THIS AGREEMENT GOVERNS IF IT CONFLICTS WITH THE AAA¬ÄôS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES OR CONSUMER ARBITRATION RULES.

I.       MICROSOFT AS PARTY OR THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY. IF MICROSOFT IS THE DEVICE MANUFACTURER OR IF YOU ACQUIRED THE SOFTWARE FROM A RETAILER, MICROSOFT IS A PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT.
